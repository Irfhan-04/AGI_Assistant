AGI Assistant - Desktop AI Observer & Automator
🎯 What This Does
AGI Assistant is a privacy-first desktop AI that:

Watches your screen and listens to your commands (locally)
Learns your repetitive workflows through AI analysis
Automates those tasks for you

Everything runs on your computer. No cloud. No data uploads.
🚀 Quick Start
Step 1: Run the Observer

Double-click AGI_Assistant_Observer.exe
Click "▶ Start Observing"
Perform a simple task (e.g., open Excel, type something, save)
Optionally speak commands while working
After 30-60 seconds, click "🔍 Analyze Workflows"
See detected patterns in the log
Click "⏸ Stop Observing" when done

Step 2: Run the Automator (Optional)

Double-click AGI_Assistant_Automator.exe
Select a detected workflow from the list
Click "▶ Execute Selected"
Watch it automate your task!

Pro Tip: Move your mouse to the top-left corner for emergency stop
📁 What Gets Stored
All data is saved in the agi_data/ folder:

screenshots/ - Screen captures (PNG images)
audio/ - Voice recordings (WAV files)
workflows/ - Detected patterns (JSON files)

Privacy: Feel free to delete any files. Everything is local.
🔧 Technical Details

🏆 Why This Submission Stands Out

Fully Local: No API keys, no servers, complete privacy
End-to-End: Demonstrates full observe → understand → automate pipeline
User-Friendly: Clean GUI, easy to test
Extensible: Architecture supports adding more automation types
Production-Ready: Error handling, safety features, clean code

📝 Future Enhancements
With more time, this could include:

Multi-modal LLM for better understanding (Llama 3.2 Vision)
Browser automation via Playwright
Custom workflow editor
Continuous learning system
Cross-platform support (Mac/Linux)
Voice-activated automation
